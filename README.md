  - What is JS:
    - TS is a JavaScript superset. Adds new features and advantades to JS. A language building up on JS. 
    - Browser can not execute it! TS is a compiler which you run over your code to compile to JS.
    - The TS compiler compiles the new features to JS "workarounds" and possible errors are thrown. This can give you a nices syntax!
- TS adds:
    - **types**. So you can identify errors earlier.
    - Next-gen JS features (compliled down for older Browsers).
    - Non-JS features like Interfaces or Generics.
    - Meta-Programming features like Decorators.
    - / has Rich Configuration Options
    - Modern Tooling that helps even in non TS Projects. e.g. VS code, uses TS in JS projects...
    - Use of **lite-server**
